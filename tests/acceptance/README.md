Acceptance tests
================

The tests will run on a dummy report generated by the reporter.
The file is generated using Mugshot, so you first need to run a browser:

```sh
npm run browser
```

You are all set to run the tests:

```sh
npm run test:acceptance
```

If you want to see the dummy report, you can generate it separately.
Two tests are made to cause diffs.

```sh
npm run test:acceptance:setup
```

The report is generated testing `tests/acceptance/setup/test.html` and saved in `visual-report`.
You can open `visual-report/statics/index.html` to check that everything is in place.
